# TODO

little eminem i made to play with the spotify API, since i dont have a client in my
computer, i made a program that fetches whats playing right now. 

For some reason the env variabke doesnt work...
just hard-code it, it doesnt last long but i will try to fix

- fix comma issue
- add options to limit display info
- optmize and break up code

`gcc spotify.c -lcurl -o spotifyC`
